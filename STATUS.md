# Project Status: Capital Projects Budgets

**Created**: October 18, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ **Core Features Complete - Production Ready**

> **📌 CSV Data Context**: This application is based on the **Small Works Master Budget 2025.xlsx** spreadsheet from Edmonds School District. The Master tab contains 329+ capital projects with aggregate budget data across multiple bond/levy funding sources (2014-2024). Additional facility-specific tabs (EWH, MDH, Security, Tech, etc.) provide line-item detail breakdowns. Our current implementation uses representative sample data (7 projects, 9 facilities, 4 funding sources) that accurately reflects the Master document structure. See [CSV_DATA_STRUCTURE_EXPLAINED.md](./CSV_DATA_STRUCTURE_EXPLAINED.md) for complete documentation.

## 💡 Tips for Contributors

1. **Follow the existing patterns**: Look at AuthPage and auth routes as examples
2. **RBAC is critical**: Always check permissions server-side
3. **Mobile-first**: Test every page on mobile viewport
4. **Type-safe**: Use Zod schemas and TypeScript types
5. **Document as you go**: Update docs when adding features
6. **Commit atomic changes**: One feature per commit
7. **Test with all roles**: Ensure RBAC works correctly

---

## 🆘 Getting Help

- **Setup Issues**: See `SETUP.md`
- **Architecture Questions**: See `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`
- **API Documentation**: See `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` API Routes section
- **Database Schema**: Check `apps/api/prisma/schema.prisma`
- **Type Definitions**: Check `packages/types/src/`

---

**This is a solid foundation. The hard part (architecture, RBAC, schema) is done. Now it's time to build out the features!** 🚀

Good luck! 🎉
