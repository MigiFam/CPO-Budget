,,,"Due to existing signs on site the city may not allow the readerboard but are open to reviewing a proposal per my last discussion with them.  I would recommend paying for design and permit documents and waiting to see if city will grant a permit before proceeding with this project.  If they deny a permit there will be no way to add a sign without eliminating an existing sign.

The display case does not require a permit and can be provided regardless.",,,,,,,,,,
