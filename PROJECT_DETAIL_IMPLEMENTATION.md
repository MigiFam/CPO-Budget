---

## ‚úÖ Completed Features

### 1. Project Detail Page (`apps/web/src/pages/ProjectDetailPage.tsx`)

**Overview Tab:**

---

### 2. Budget Lines Table Component (`apps/web/src/components/BudgetLinesTable.tsx`)

**Display Features:**
- Comprehensive table with 8 columns:
  1. Cost Code (monospace font)
  2. Category (labeled badges: Design, Construction, Equipment, etc.)
  3. Description
  4. Baseline (formatted currency)
  5. Committed (formatted currency)
  6. Actuals (formatted currency)
  7. Variance (color-coded: green if positive, red if negative)
  8. % Used (red if > 100%, showing over-budget lines)
- **Totals Row** (bold, gray background):
  - Sums all columns
  - Calculates overall % used
  - Color-coded variance (green/red)
- Empty state with "Add First Budget Line" CTA
- Loading spinner while fetching
- Responsive horizontal scroll on mobile

**Category Labels Mapping:**
```typescript
DESIGN ‚Üí "Design"
CONSTRUCTION ‚Üí "Construction"
EQUIPMENT ‚Üí "Equipment"
CONTINGENCY ‚Üí "Contingency"
SOFT_COSTS ‚Üí "Soft Costs"
TESTING ‚Üí "Testing"
OTHER ‚Üí "Other"
```

---

### 3. Budget Lines React Query Hook (`apps/web/src/hooks/useBudgetLines.ts`)

**Interface:**
```typescript
interface BudgetLine {
  id: string;
  costCode: string;
  category: 'DESIGN' | 'CONSTRUCTION' | 'EQUIPMENT' | 'CONTINGENCY' | 'SOFT_COSTS' | 'TESTING' | 'OTHER';
  description?: string;
  baselineAmount: number;
  committedToDate: number;
  actualsToDate: number;
  variance: number;
  budgetId: string;
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
}
```

**Hooks:**
1. `useBudgetLines(budgetId)` - Fetches all budget lines for a budget
2. `useBudgetLine(budgetLineId)` - Fetches single budget line
3. `useCreateBudgetLine(budgetId)` - Mutation for creating (invalidates queries)
4. `useUpdateBudgetLine(budgetLineId, budgetId)` - Mutation for updating
5. `useDeleteBudgetLine(budgetId)` - Mutation for deleting

**Features:**
- Automatic cache invalidation on mutations
- Invalidates both budget lines and projects queries (to update parent budget totals)
- Disabled queries when budgetId is undefined
- TypeScript-typed request/response data

---

### 4. Budget Lines API Routes (`apps/api/src/routes/budgetLine.routes.ts`)

**Endpoints:**

**GET /api/budgets/:budgetId/budget-lines**
- Returns all budget lines for a budget, sorted by cost code
- RBAC: Requires `hasProjectAccess()` check (Director sees all, others only assigned projects)
- Returns 403 if no access, 404 if budget not found

**GET /api/budget-lines/:id**
- Returns single budget line with full details
- RBAC: Same access check via project relationship

**POST /api/budgets/:budgetId/budget-lines**
- Creates new budget line
- RBAC: Only Director, Finance, or assigned PM can create
- Validation: Checks for duplicate cost code within budget (returns 400)
- Auto-calculates: `variance = baselineAmount`, `committedToDate = 0`, `actualsToDate = 0`
- Creates audit log with CREATE action
- Returns 201 with created budget line

**PATCH /api/budget-lines/:id**
- Updates existing budget line
- RBAC: Only Director, Finance, or assigned PM can update
- Validation: Checks for duplicate cost code if changing it
- Recalculates variance if `baselineAmount` changes: `variance = baselineAmount - actualsToDate`
- Creates audit log with UPDATE action
- Returns updated budget line

**DELETE /api/budget-lines/:id**
- Deletes budget line
- RBAC: **Only Director** can delete (strictest permission)
- Creates audit log with DELETE action
- Returns 204 No Content

**RBAC Implementation:**
- All routes use `requireAuth` middleware
- Checks `hasProjectAccess(userId, projectId, role)` (3 params, not 4)
- Director can see all, others filtered by team assignment or PM role
- Create/Edit restricted to Director, Finance, assigned PM
- Delete restricted to Director only

**Audit Logging:**
```typescript
await createAuditLog({
  organizationId: user.organizationId,
  actorId: user.id,
  entity: 'BUDGET_LINE',
  entityId: budgetLine.id,
  action: 'CREATE' | 'UPDATE' | 'DELETE',
  diffJSON: { /* changes */ },
});
```

## üîó Integration Points

### Frontend ‚Üí Backend Flow:
1. User navigates to `/projects/:id`
2. `ProjectDetailPage` calls `useProject(projectId)`
3. API GET `/api/projects/:id` returns project with budget data
4. User clicks "Budget" tab
5. `BudgetLinesTable` calls `useBudgetLines(budget.id)`
6. API GET `/api/budgets/:budgetId/budget-lines` returns array of budget lines
7. Table renders with totals calculated client-side

### Data Structure:
```
Project (from useProject)
‚îî‚îÄ budgets[0]
   ‚îú‚îÄ id: string (passed to useBudgetLines)
   ‚îú‚îÄ baselineAmount: number
   ‚îú‚îÄ committedToDate: number
   ‚îú‚îÄ actualsToDate: number
   ‚îî‚îÄ variance: number

BudgetLine[] (from useBudgetLines)
‚îú‚îÄ costCode: string (e.g., "1010-DESIGN")
‚îú‚îÄ category: enum
‚îú‚îÄ baselineAmount: number
‚îú‚îÄ committedToDate: number (updated by cost events)
‚îú‚îÄ actualsToDate: number (updated by invoices)
‚îî‚îÄ variance: number (baselineAmount - actualsToDate)
```

## üß™ Testing Instructions

### 1. Start Servers:
```powershell
# Terminal 1: API Server
cd 'd:\Git\CPO budget app\apps\api'
npm run dev

# Terminal 2: Web App
cd 'd:\Git\CPO budget app\apps\web'
npm run dev
```

### 2. Login:
- Navigate to `http://localhost:5173`
- Login as:
  - **director@cpo.app** / Demo!Pass1 (see all projects)
  - **pm1@cpo.app** / Demo!Pass1 (see assigned projects only)

### 3. Test Project Detail Page:
1. Click on any project card from Projects page
2. Verify Overview tab shows:
   - Project details (name, description, dates)
   - Quick stats cards with real budget data
   - Progress bars for committed/spent
   - Activity summary
3. Click "Budget" tab
4. Verify budget lines table shows (if seeded data exists) or empty state

### 4. Test RBAC:
- Login as **pm1@cpo.app**
- Navigate to Projects
- Should only see projects where pm1 is assigned or is team member
- Click project ‚Üí Budget tab
- Should NOT see "Add Budget Line" button (only Director/Finance/assigned PM)

- Login as **director@cpo.app**
- Navigate to any project ‚Üí Budget tab
- Should see "Add Budget Line" button
- (Button currently shows alert - full form implementation is next phase)

### 5. Verify API Endpoints:
Using Postman or curl:

```bash
# Get auth token first
POST http://localhost:3001/api/auth/login
Body: { "email": "director@cpo.app", "password": "Demo!Pass1" }
# Copy token from response

# Get budget lines (replace :budgetId with actual ID from seeded data)
GET http://localhost:3001/api/budgets/:budgetId/budget-lines
Header: Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

## üêõ Known Limitations

1. **Budget Lines Seed Data**: Current seed script doesn't create budget lines, so table will show empty state until manually created via API

2. **Add/Edit Forms**: "Add Budget Line" button shows alert - forms need to be built in next phase

3. **Real-time Updates**: Budget line changes don't yet trigger parent budget recalculation (needs integration with `budgetCalculations.ts` service)

4. **Cost Events Integration**: Committed/Actuals columns will always show 0 until cost events are created and approved

5. **Missing Route Implementations**: Several routes imported in `index.ts` don't exist yet (costEvent, vendor, comment, issue, report, audit) - these will cause TypeScript errors but don't affect runtime
