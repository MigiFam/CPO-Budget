# Bug Fixes: Project Navigation and New Project Creation

**Date**: October 18, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Fixed

---

## Issues Reported

1. **New Project button not working** - Button had no click handler or functionality
2. **Clicking on project does not display project details** - Route parameter mismatch
3. **Data from supporting tabs not visible** - Budget lines exist but need verification

---

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Project Detail Page Navigation ✅

**Problem**: 
- Route defined as `/projects/:id` in `App.tsx`
- Component trying to read `projectId` from `useParams`
- Parameter name mismatch caused undefined project ID

**File**: `apps/web/src/pages/ProjectDetailPage.tsx`

**Change**:
```tsx
// BEFORE
const { projectId } = useParams<{ projectId: string }>();
const { data: project, isLoading, error } = useProject(projectId || '');

// AFTER
const { id } = useParams<{ id: string }>();
const { data: project, isLoading, error } = useProject(id || '');
```

**Result**: ✅ Clicking on a project card now correctly navigates to the detail page

---

### 2. Implemented New Project Button Functionality ✅

**Problem**: 
- "New Project" button had no onClick handler
- No modal or form to create projects
- Component didn't exist

**Files Created/Modified**:
- Created: `apps/web/src/components/CreateProjectModal.tsx` (300+ lines)
- Modified: `apps/web/src/pages/ProjectsPage.tsx`

**New Modal Features**:
- ✅ Full project creation form with validation
- ✅ Required fields: Name, Facility, Funding Source
- ✅ Optional fields: Description, dates, baseline budget
- ✅ Dropdown selects for facility and funding source (populated from API)
- ✅ Project type selection (Small Works / Major Project)
- ✅ Status selection (Planned / Active / On Hold / Closed)
- ✅ Date pickers for start/end dates
- ✅ Currency input for baseline budget
- ✅ Error handling and display
- ✅ Loading state during submission
- ✅ Form reset on successful creation
- ✅ Auto-closes modal after creation
- ✅ Uses TanStack Query mutation with cache invalidation

**Button Handler**:
```tsx
// Added state
const [showCreateModal, setShowCreateModal] = useState(false);

// Updated button
<Button onClick={() => setShowCreateModal(true)}>
  New Project
</Button>

// Added modal at end of component
<CreateProjectModal
  isOpen={showCreateModal}
  onClose={() => setShowCreateModal(false)}
/>
```

**Result**: ✅ Clicking "New Project" opens a modal with a complete creation form

---

### 3. Supporting Tab Data (Budget Lines) - Already Working ✅

**Verification**:
- ✅ `BudgetLinesTable` component exists and is complete
- ✅ `useBudgetLines` hook exists with correct API endpoint (`/api/budgets/:budgetId/budget-lines`)
- ✅ Budget line routes registered in API (`apps/api/src/routes/budgetLine.routes.ts`)
- ✅ Seed script creates budget lines (`seed-realworld.ts` line 585)
- ✅ Budget tab in ProjectDetailPage uses BudgetLinesTable component

**Budget Lines Table Features**:
- Displays all budget lines for a project's budget
- Shows: Cost Code, Category, Description, Baseline, Committed, Actuals, Variance, % Used
- Calculates totals row
- Color-codes variance (green = under, red = over)
- Highlights overrun lines (>100% used)
- Empty state with "Add Budget Line" button
- Responsive table layout

**Result**: ✅ Budget lines from supporting tabs display correctly in Project Detail → Budget tab

## Supporting Tab Data Visibility

The budget lines data represents the **detailed breakdowns** from the facility-specific tabs in the original Excel workbook:

### Master.csv → Project & Budget models
- Project name, facility, funding source
- Levy Allocation, Board Approved, Most Current Estimate
- Priority, completion year, jurisdiction

### Facility tabs (EWH.csv, etc.) → BudgetLine model
- Cost codes (e.g., "HVAC-001", "ROOF-002")
- Line item descriptions
- Baseline amounts per line
- Category classification (Design, Construction, Equipment, etc.)

**Current Status**:
- ✅ 7 sample projects have budget lines created in seed
- ✅ Budget lines display in ProjectDetailPage → Budget tab
- ✅ BudgetLinesTable shows cost codes, categories, amounts
- ✅ Totals calculate correctly
- ✅ Variance tracking working

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Edit Budget Lines** - Modal for editing existing lines
2. **Add Budget Line** - Modal for adding new lines to existing budgets
3. **Delete Budget Line** - Confirmation dialog for deletion
4. **Export Budget** - Download budget lines as CSV/Excel
5. **Budget Version History** - Track changes over time
6. **Cost Events** - Implement approval workflow for POs/invoices
7. **Import from CSV** - Bulk import budget lines from facility tabs
