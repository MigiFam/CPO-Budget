- ✅ **Other Costs Section**:
  - CPO Management with percentage (e.g., "CPO Management (10%)")
  - A/E Fee (if applicable)
  - Consultants (if applicable)
  - Other Cost Subtotal (calculated, highlighted)
- ✅ **Total Project Cost** (grand total, bold)
- ✅ **Remainder** (green if under budget, red if over budget)
- ✅ Most Current Date
- ✅ **Status Alerts**:
  - Green alert: "Project is under budget by $X"
  - Red alert: "Project is over budget by $X"

**Styling**:
- Orange gradient header (matching Excel color scheme)
- Alternating row backgrounds for subtotals
- Color-coded remainder (green/red)
- Responsive grid layout
- Clean, professional appearance

### 2. Project Detail Page Integration

**Changes**:
- ✅ Added new "Budget Breakdown" tab (with Receipt icon)
- ✅ Renders ProjectBudgetBreakdown component
- ✅ Tab placed between "Budget Lines" and "Cost Events"

### 3. API Enhancement
**File**: `apps/api/src/routes/project.routes.ts`

**Changes**:
- ✅ GET `/api/projects/:id` now includes `projectBudgets` relation
- ✅ Returns most recent budget breakdown (orderBy createdAt desc, take 1)

### 4. Seed Data
**File**: `apps/api/prisma/seed-project-budgets.ts`

**Populated**:
- ✅ Stadium ticket booth project with full budget breakdown
  - Approved Budget: $60,000
  - Total Project Cost: $57,679.01
  - Remainder: **$2,320.99** (under budget ✅)
  
- ✅ Playground equipment project with full budget breakdown
  - Approved Budget: $9,219.03
  - Total Project Cost: $9,219.03
  - Remainder: **$0.00** (exactly on budget)

## How to View

1. **Navigate to Projects page**: http://localhost:5173/projects
2. **Click on any project** (e.g., "Stadium ticket booth / gates")
3. **Click the "Budget Breakdown" tab**
4. **See the detailed breakdown** exactly like your Excel screenshot!

## Data Flow

```
User clicks project
    ↓
GET /api/projects/:id
    ↓
Returns project with projectBudgets[]
    ↓
ProjectBudgetBreakdown component
    ↓
Displays formatted budget with:
- Input fields (base bid, tax rates, etc.)
- Computed fields (subtotals, total, remainder)
- Color-coded alerts
```

## Computed Fields

All calculations are **server-side** using `projectBudgetCalculations.ts`:

1. **Sales Tax Amount** = (Base Bid + Change Orders) × (Tax Rate % ÷ 100)
2. **Construction Subtotal** = Base Bid + Change Orders + Sales Tax
3. **CPO Management** = Construction Subtotal × (CPO Rate % ÷ 100)
4. **Other Subtotal** = CPO Management + Tech + Consultants
5. **Total Project Cost** = Construction Subtotal + Other Subtotal
6. **Remainder** = Approved Budget - Total Project Cost

## Example Output

For "Stadium ticket booth / gates":

```
Total Approved Project Budget:     $60,000.00

Base Bid:                          $37,410.00
Construction Contingency (10%):    $10,000.00
Sales Tax (10.6%):                  $5,025.46
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Construction Cost Subtotal:        $52,435.46

CPO Management (10%):               $5,243.55
A/E Fee:                                    -
Consultants:                                -
