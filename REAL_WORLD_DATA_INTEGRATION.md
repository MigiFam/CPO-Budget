# Real-World Data Integration Complete ✅

## Overview
Successfully integrated the **Small Works Master Budget 2025** CSV data into the Capital Projects Office Budget App. The database schema and seed data now match the actual workflow used by Edmonds School District.

## What Was Done

### 1. Schema Updates (Migration: 20251019023515_add_real_world_budget_fields)

- **LABOR**: $30,000 baseline → $28,179.01 actuals = $1,820.99 under
- **MATERIALS**: $15,000 baseline → $15,000 actuals = $0 variance
- **EQUIPMENT**: $5,000 baseline → $5,000 actuals = $0 variance
- **CONTINGENCY**: $2,000 baseline → $0 used = $2,000 remaining

#### Teams
- **Project 001 Team**: Carol (PM) + Eve (Team Member)
- **LED Retrofit Team**: David (PM) + Eve (Team Member) + George (Electrical Contractor)

## Budget Tracking Pattern

The system now tracks **three levels of budgeting**:

### Level 1: Levy Allocation
The initial amount allocated from the bond or levy measure. This is the "pool" of money available.

### Level 2: Board Approved Budget
The amount the board has authorized to spend on this specific project. Can be more or less than the allocation.

### Level 3: Most Current Estimate
The actual estimated or final cost based on bids, change orders, and actuals.

### Variance Tracking
- **Board Budget Remainder**: `boardApprovedBudget - mostCurrentEstimate`
  - Positive = Under budget ✅
  - Negative = Over budget ⚠️
  
- **Levy Allocation Remainder**: `levyAllocation - boardApprovedBudget`
  - Positive = Funds available for other projects
  - Negative = Used more than allocated (but board approved it)

## CSV Data Source

Original file: **Small Works Master Budget 2025.xlsx - Small Works.csv**
- 329+ total projects
- 6 funding sources (added 2016 Levy and 2014 Bond not yet in seed)
- 30+ facilities
- Budget tracking across 15 years (2015-2029)

## Next Steps

### Frontend Updates Needed
1. **Display new fields in UI**:
   - Show priority, completion year, jurisdiction on ProjectCard
   - Show all three budget amounts (allocation, board approved, estimate) in ProjectDetailPage
   - Add completion year and jurisdiction filters to ProjectsPage
   
2. **Dashboard enhancements**:
   - Group projects by completion year (2025 projects, 2026 projects, etc.)
   - Show allocation vs approved vs estimate comparison
   
3. **CSV Import Tool** (future):
   - Upload CSV to bulk import all 329+ projects
   - Validate facility codes and funding sources
   - Handle duplicate detection

### Backend Updates Needed
1. **API endpoints**:
   - Add query params for `completionYear`, `jurisdiction`, `priority` filtering
   - Add endpoint to retrieve budget history (all versions)
   
2. **Remaining APIs**:
   - Cost Events workflow (Task 5 from todo list)
