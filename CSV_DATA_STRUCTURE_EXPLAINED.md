## 📋 Document Structure Overview

The Excel workbook you shared contains multiple tabs/sheets:

### 1. **Master Tab** (Main Aggregate View)
- **File**: `Small Works Master Budget to Gilbert 2025.xlsx - Master.csv`
- **Purpose**: **Aggregate summary** of all capital projects across all funding sources
- **Row Count**: 329+ projects

## 📊 Master Document Purpose

The **Master.csv** tab serves as the **single source of truth** for:

### Budget Planning
- Complete list of all approved capital projects
- Total budget across all funding sources
- Priority order for execution
- Completion year planning

### Financial Tracking
- **Levy/Bond Allocation**: Initial amount allocated from voter-approved measures
- **Board Approved Budget**: Amount approved by school board for the project
- **Most Current Estimate**: Latest cost estimate (may change due to bids, scope changes)
- **Remainders**: Track variance between allocation → board approval → current estimate

### Reporting
- Roll-up view for board presentations
- Fund balance tracking (how much left in each bond/levy)
- Multi-year planning (2015-2029)
- Jurisdiction-based reporting (required for some funding sources)

---

## 🗂️ Supporting Tabs Purpose

The **facility/category-specific tabs** provide **operational details**:

### For Project Managers
- Line-item cost breakdowns
- Specific scope details
- Vendor assignments
- Timeline milestones
- Notes on issues/changes

### For Facility Managers
- All work planned for their building
- Prioritization within their facility
- Coordination with ongoing operations

### For Category Managers
- All security projects across district
- All technology upgrades
- Partnership/grant-funded projects
- Maintenance/transportation fleet projects

## 💡 Key Insight for Our Application

### What This Means for the Schema

The **Master.csv** structure drives our **Project** and **Budget** models:

#### Each Row in Master.csv = 1 Project Record

```typescript
Project {
  name: "Replace Roof - Main Building"
  priority: "001"
  completionYear: 2025
  jurisdiction: "Edmonds"
  facility: Facility (EWH)
  fundingSource: FundingSource (2024 Bond)
  
  budgets: [
    Budget {
      version: "Initial Allocation"
      levyAllocation: 500000.00
      boardApprovedBudget: 475000.00
      mostCurrentEstimate: 490000.00
      levyAllocationRemainder: 25000.00  // Allocation - Board Approved
      boardBudgetRemainder: -15000.00    // Board Approved - Current Estimate
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Supporting Tabs = Budget Lines & Cost Events

The detail from facility-specific tabs becomes:

```typescript
BudgetLine {
  budget: Budget (parent)
  costCode: "R-001" // Roofing
  description: "Tear-off and disposal"
  amount: 50000.00
  vendor: Vendor ("ABC Roofing")
  status: "COMMITTED"
}

CostEvent {
  project: Project (parent)
  type: "CONTRACT_AWARD"
  amount: 490000.00
  description: "Contract awarded to ABC Roofing"
  vendor: Vendor
  status: "APPROVED"
}
```

## 🎯 Current Implementation Status

### What We're Using Now

Our current seed data (`seed-realworld.ts`) uses **sample data from the Master.csv**:

✅ **7 representative projects** covering:
- Different facilities (EWH, MDH, LWH, etc.)
- Different funding sources (2020/2021/2023 GO Bonds, Impact Fees)
- Different budget tracking patterns (allocation → approved → estimate)
- Different completion years (2025, 2026, 2027)

✅ **9 facilities** with codes and jurisdictions

✅ **4 funding sources** with years and total allocations

✅ **Budget version tracking** showing the allocation → approved → estimate progression

### What We Could Add

For a **full production implementation**, we could:

1. **Import all 329+ projects** from Master.csv
2. **Parse all facility tabs** for budget line details
3. **Extract cost codes** and create cost code taxonomy
4. **Import vendor data** from the detailed tabs
5. **Create historical cost events** from the tracking data

## 📝 Why This Matters

Understanding the Master + Supporting Tabs structure helps us:

### 1. **Data Integrity**
- Master is authoritative for project-level budget totals
- Supporting tabs provide audit trail and line-item detail
- Our schema supports both levels (Project/Budget + BudgetLines)

### 2. **User Workflow**
- Directors/Finance need **Master view** (what we show in Dashboard/Projects pages)
- Project Managers need **Detail view** (what we show in ProjectDetailPage → Budget tab)
- Our UI matches this hierarchy

### 3. **Reporting Requirements**
- Board reports pull from Master-level data
- Audit reports need line-item detail from supporting tabs
- Our API supports both (summary endpoints + detail endpoints)

### 4. **Future Enhancements**
- Could add CSV import for all 329+ projects
- Could parse supporting tabs for automatic budget line creation
- Could track which tab/category a project belongs to
- Could generate facility-specific reports from the facility tabs

## 🔄 Data Flow in Real Use

```
User Actions → Application → Database → Reports
────────────────────────────────────────────────

1. Board approves bond measure
   → Create FundingSource (e.g., "2024 Bond", $35M)

2. Projects planned across facilities
   → Create Projects with initial allocations
   → Master.csv equivalents

3. Board approves project budgets
   → Create Budget record with boardApprovedBudget
   → Master.csv "Board Approved Budget" column

4. Bids received, scope refined
   → Update Budget with mostCurrentEstimate
   → Master.csv "Most Current Estimate" column

5. Project work broken into line items
   → Create BudgetLines for each cost code
   → Facility tabs detail level

6. Contracts awarded
   → Create CostEvents (type: CONTRACT_AWARD)
   → Track in facility tabs

7. Work completed, invoices paid
   → Create CostEvents (type: INVOICE_PAID)
   → Update committedToDate, actualsToDate

8. Project closed
   → Status = CLOSED
   → Final remainders calculated
```

## ✅ Validation

Our current implementation **correctly interprets** the Master document:

1. ✅ Projects have funding source + facility relationships
2. ✅ Budget tracking shows allocation → approved → estimate progression
3. ✅ Remainder calculations work (levyAllocationRemainder, boardBudgetRemainder)
4. ✅ Facility codes and jurisdictions included
5. ✅ Funding source years and totals tracked
6. ✅ Priority and completion year fields added
7. ✅ Multi-year, multi-facility, multi-funding structure supported

The schema and seed data accurately reflect the **real-world capital projects budget management** workflow from the Edmonds School District.

## 🚀 Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

If you want to expand beyond the sample data:

1. **Full CSV Import**
   - Parse Master.csv → create all 329+ projects
   - Validate against funding source totals
   - Set up completion year milestones

2. **Facility Tab Parsing**
   - Parse each facility CSV → create BudgetLines
   - Extract cost codes → create taxonomy
   - Link vendors → create Vendor records

3. **Historical Data**
   - Import closed projects (2015-2024)
   - Track actual vs. estimated over time
   - Build historical accuracy metrics

4. **Advanced Reporting**
   - Generate Master-style reports from live data
   - Export facility-specific tabs on demand
   - Create board presentation views

---

**Current Status**: Sample data correctly represents Master document structure ✅  
**Schema**: Fully supports both Master and Supporting tab data structures ✅  
**Application**: Ready for full production data import if needed ✅
