# Frontend Implementation Progress

## ‚úÖ Completed Features

### 1. Projects Page (`/projects`)
- **Full CRUD Integration**: Connected to backend Projects API with React Query
- **Smart Filtering**: 
  - Filter by Facility (dropdown populated from API)
  - Filter by Funding Source (dropdown populated from API)
  - Filter by Status (PLANNED, ACTIVE, ON_HOLD, CLOSED)
  - Filter by Project Type (SMALL_WORKS, MAJOR)
  - Clear all filters button
- **Project Cards**: Beautiful, mobile-responsive cards showing:
  - Project name, description, status badge
  - Facility, funding source, project manager
  - Budget summary with baseline, actuals, variance %
  - Team/comment/issue counts
  - Clickable to navigate to project details
- **States**:
  - Loading spinner
  - Error handling with retry
  - Empty state (with different messages for filtered vs no data)
  - Result count display

### 2. Dashboard Page (`/`)
- **Real-time Metrics**: Connected to live data via React Query
  - Total projects count (with active count)
  - Total budget across all funding sources
  - Committed costs with percentage
  - Actual costs with percentage spent
- **Funding Source Breakdown**:
  - Aggregated data by bond/levy/grant
  - Shows project count per source
  - Displays budget, committed, actuals, variance
  - Progress percentage
  - Clickable cards that filter projects by funding source
- **RBAC-Aware**:
  - Director sees all projects
  - Other roles see only their accessible projects
  - Description changes based on role
- **Loading State**: Spinner while data loads

### 3. React Query Hooks
Created reusable hooks for data fetching:

#### `useProjects(filters)`
- Fetches projects with optional filters
- Automatically refetches on filter changes
- Invalidates cache on mutations

#### `useFacilities(type?)`
- Fetches all facilities or filtered by type
- Used in project filters dropdown

#### `useFundingSources(type?)`
- Fetches all funding sources
- Used in project filters dropdown

#### `useDashboard()`
- Aggregates project data client-side
- Calculates totals by funding source and facility
- Returns summary statistics

### 4. UI Components

#### `ProjectCard`
- Responsive card component
- Status badges with color coding
- Budget visualization
- Icon-based metadata display
- Hover effects

#### Existing Components Enhanced
- Button, Input, Card components already in place
- Tailwind CSS for consistent styling
- Mobile-first responsive design

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Highlights

### Data Flow
```
Component ‚Üí React Query Hook ‚Üí API Client (axios) ‚Üí Backend API ‚Üí Prisma ‚Üí PostgreSQL
```

### State Management
- **Server State**: React Query (projects, facilities, funding sources)
- **Client State**: Zustand (auth, user)
- **URL State**: React Router search params (filters)

### Type Safety
- TypeScript interfaces for all API responses
- Type-safe hooks with generics
- Proper error typing

### Performance
- Automatic caching via React Query
- Stale-while-revalidate strategy
- Optimistic updates ready (for mutations)
- Query invalidation on create/update/delete

## üì± Mobile Responsiveness

All pages are fully responsive:
- **Desktop**: 3-column grid for project cards
- **Tablet**: 2-column grid
- **Mobile**: Single column, full-width cards
- Touch-friendly buttons and inputs
- Responsive navigation

## üîí RBAC Implementation

Frontend respects backend RBAC:
- Projects filtered by role on backend
- Director sees all projects
- PM sees assigned projects
- Team members see their team's projects
- UI adapts based on user role

## üé® Design System

- **Colors**: Blue primary, semantic colors for status
- **Typography**: Clear hierarchy with bold headings
- **Spacing**: Consistent padding/margins
- **Icons**: SVG icons for actions and metadata
- **Feedback**: Loading states, error messages, empty states

## üöÄ What's Working NOW

You can test the app at **http://localhost:5173**:

1. **Login** as any demo user:
   - director@cpo.app / Demo!Pass1
   - finance@cpo.app / Demo!Pass1
   - pm1@cpo.app / Demo!Pass1
   - etc.

2. **Dashboard** shows:
   - Real project counts from database
   - Budget totals calculated from seeded data
   - Funding source breakdown (2024 Capital Bond, 2023 Technology Levy)

3. **Projects Page** displays:
   - 3 seeded projects (Lincoln High HVAC, Roosevelt Elementary Roof, Madison Middle Playground)
   - Working filters
   - Clickable cards (detail page not yet implemented)

## üéØ Next Steps

To complete the frontend:

1. **Project Detail Page** (`/projects/:id`)
   - Overview tab
   - Budget tab with budget lines
   - Cost events timeline
   - Team members list
   - Comments section

2. **Budget Management UI**
   - Budget lines table
   - Add/edit budget line modals
   - Cost event submission form
   - Approval workflow UI

3. **Navigation Improvements**
   - Breadcrumbs
   - Back buttons
   - Active link highlighting

4. **Forms**
   - Create project form
   - Create facility form
   - Edit modals

5. **Polish**
   - Toast notifications
   - Confirmation dialogs
   - Better error messages
   - Skeleton loaders

## üìä Current State

- ‚úÖ **Backend**: API running, database seeded, RBAC working
- ‚úÖ **Authentication**: Login flow complete
- ‚úÖ **Dashboard**: Real data, working metrics
- ‚úÖ **Projects List**: Full CRUD hooks, filters, responsive UI
- ‚è≥ **Project Details**: Needs implementation
- ‚è≥ **Budget UI**: Needs implementation
- ‚è≥ **Forms**: Need implementation

**Completion: ~60%** of frontend features implemented!
