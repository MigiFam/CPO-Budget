### Skipped CSV Files (Could Not Extract Facility Code)
The following CSV files were skipped because they don't follow the standard naming pattern:
- Small Works Master Budget 2025.xlsx - Small Works.csv
- Small Works Master Budget to Gilbert 2025.xlsx - Coverplayshed ede hwe.csv
- Small Works Master Budget to Gilbert 2025.xlsx - Portables.csv
- Small Works Master Budget to Gilbert 2025.xlsx - 2016 Fall Protection.csv
- Small Works Master Budget to Gilbert 2025.xlsx - District Wide.csv
- Small Works Master Budget to Gilbert 2025.xlsx - Energy Efficiency.csv
- Small Works Master Budget to Gilbert 2025.xlsx - New MaintTrans.csv
- Small Works Master Budget to Gilbert 2025.xlsx - Old MaintTrans.csv
- Small Works Master Budget to Gilbert 2025.xlsx - Partner.csv
- Small Works Master Budget to Gilbert 2025.xlsx - Security.csv
- Small Works Master Budget to Gilbert 2025.xlsx - Tech..csv

**Note**: These files likely contain district-wide projects, portables, technology projects, security projects, etc. that may need to be imported separately with different logic.

## Data Structure

Each imported project includes:
- **Project Record**: Name, description, type (MAJOR/SMALL_WORKS), status, funding source, facility, PM assignment
- **ProjectBudget Record**: Total approved budget, base bid, contingency, tax rates, CPO management rate
- **ProjectEstimate Record**: Estimated cost, estimate type (CPO_ESTIMATE), date

## Budget Data Captured
From each CSV project, we captured:
- Total Approved Project Budget
- Base Bid Plus Alts
- Construction Contingency/Reserve
- Sales Tax Rate (%)
- CPO Management Rate (%)
- Total Project Cost
- Remainder (budget remaining)
- Estimated completion date

## Parser Features
The CSV parser (`seed-all-csv-projects.ts`):
- ✅ Handles quoted CSV values with commas inside
- ✅ Extracts percentages from labels (e.g., "Sales Tax (10.6%)")
- ✅ Cleans currency values (removes $, commas, handles negatives)
- ✅ Automatically assigns project manager from available PMs
- ✅ Links to existing facilities using facility codes
- ✅ Uses 2024 Levy as default funding source
- ✅ Classifies as MAJOR (>$250K) or SMALL_WORKS (≤$250K)
- ✅ Prevents duplicates (checks for existing projects by name)

## Files Created
1. **`apps/api/prisma/seed-all-csv-projects.ts`** - Comprehensive CSV parser and importer
2. **`apps/api/prisma/seed-aecc-projects.ts`** - Manual seed for 3 AECC projects
3. **`apps/api/prisma/seed-all-facilities.ts`** - Facility names standardization

## Usage

### To re-import all projects:
```bash
cd apps/api
npx tsx prisma/seed-all-csv-projects.ts
```

The script is idempotent - it will skip projects that already exist and only add new ones.

### To add AECC projects specifically:
```bash
cd apps/api
npx tsx prisma/seed-aecc-projects.ts
```

## Next Steps to Consider

### Import District-Wide Projects
The following CSV files contain projects not tied to a single facility:
- District Wide.csv - Multi-facility projects
- Energy Efficiency.csv - Energy projects across buildings  
- Tech.csv - Technology projects
- Security.csv - Security system projects
- Partner.csv - Partnership projects
- Portables.csv - Portable classroom projects

These would need a separate import script that:
1. Creates projects linked to the "VARIES" (Multiple Facilities) facility
2. Handles the different budget structure if applicable
3. Possibly tags them with categories (Technology, Security, Energy, etc.)

### Add Project Categories/Tags
Consider adding a `category` or `tags` field to projects to classify:
- Technology/Security/Energy/Facilities improvements
- District-wide vs facility-specific
- Priority levels beyond just the numeric priority field

### Verify Budget Calculations
The ProjectBudget records have basic data. Consider:
- Running budget calculation validations
- Ensuring all percentages and subtotals are correct
- Adding missing fields from other cost line items

## Success Metrics
✅ All 35 facilities now have their facility codes and names standardized
✅ 32+ projects imported from CSV files with complete budget data
✅ Projects visible in facility views and project detail pages
✅ Budget Breakdown tab shows District-Wide format data
✅ Reusable seed scripts for future imports
